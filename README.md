# employeesDatabase

This is a Database that uses CRUD.
I made different employees and ensured my database works by reading them.
I was also able to create new employees and saved them (singular and plural), I was able to update employees, and I was also able to delete employees.
The last thing I was able to do was find employees by first and last names :)
